# cycling recovery

# abstract
Everything I think I know about recovery / cycling recovery. 
Recovering is almost or even more important than the work and workouts itself. Only in recovery the body makes adaptations and you get stronger. This is true on the macro and micro perspective. Normal workoutplans are three weeks on and one week of within a week you need to recover between workouts in order to get the max out of them. 
Within a week this can range from one, two or even three days recovery.

# difference between a recovery day and endurance day
The name might be indicating it but these two are not the same. 
Often and I made this mistake two getting cheaky and thinking "on my recoveryday I go so easy that I can do it a bit harder and make it an endrance day I will recover and traing endurance" -> "does this work?" -> "No dont do!"
Recovery days have to be so easy that it should be embarrising to upload your ride to strava. [^1] 
Recovery rides should only follow one purpose and one purpose only: 

> HELP YOU RECOVER

the rest itself from a recovery ride and the recovery helps you to set new trainings simulus the following hard or endurance days. 

# spin to win
One tipp to keep your recovery ride very easy is to spin a high gear. This is great since its harder to go into endurance zone and the high cadance help with getting a lot of blood to your legs which will help to flush out the legs. 

# recovery ride vs total rest
If you asked me few years every day not riden was a day lost. Now since I am a bit older I enjoy complete off days quite a lot. There is much time to get your normal life sorted do something other then cycling and not physicly also mentally recover from cycling. 
Therefor my opinion changed a bit on complete offdays I prefere them over recoveryrides and complete take the days off. This somewhat seem in line what UAE is doing which is shown in charlies video Sivakov takes compelte offdays only walks. [^2] 
Only danger in complete off days is body shuts down too much and is not fireing the next days. I only get that feeling while I litterly do nothing on my off days and lay around all day. This can be prevented by a walk / groceries shopping / go shopping etc. 
The reader should find out for themself if complete offdays feel better then recoveryrides. Except for the day after a hard race there I definitly would recommend a recovery ride to get blood to the legs.

# dos and don'ts - summary - tl;dr 
- recovery ride duration should not be more then 1,5h 
- recovery ride should not have any power or heartrate spikes -> plan route accodingly recommended mostly flat
- recovery ride upper target power / heartrate is beginning of zone 2 -> you should try to stay in zone 1
