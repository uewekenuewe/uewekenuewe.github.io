# why
While my cycling endevour is comming to a close probbly 2026 will be the year with much free time. Assuming I traing 14h average over the hole year this is a lot of time on my hands. While I probbly never will quit cycling as a hole going into maintaince mode should only take up 5-7hr a week. 
Doing a "nerd-year" was part inspired by my lack of time for 2024s Advent-of-code which I participate for few years not with my two brothers and some others. Not having won any addition so far really urges me to spend more time sharpen up on my competetive programming. 
But there is plent more this article should be a layout and thought about what 2026 could be.
