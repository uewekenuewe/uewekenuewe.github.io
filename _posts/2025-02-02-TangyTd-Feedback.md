# Feedback Tangy TD 

# Introduction
Hi Cakez, I found your channel a few months ago and really like your content, which motivated me to play your game and hopefully give some constructive feedback. 

# Setup 
I am running windows 11 on a shitty laptop. I had no performance issues games runs always at 60 FPS.

# Gameplay 
So far I have played 4 hours and not beaten the game yet. I like the vampire surviors // halls of tormet elements play rounds, get gold, progress into the game. 
I had NO game crashes, freezes or anything interrupting game play experience, good job for that! So what now follows are somethings I might have done differently 
or quarks found in the animation / ui. Please if I missed something assume I am stupid and ignore :)

# default volume is 0
First start of the game default volume was zero.

# hero placement 
I would like to game to have a grind where heros can placed more easly. I started playing on my touch pad and then switch back playing with mouse does make the game easier.

# collection    
Scrolling is messed up here. On libary screen scrolling just works fine.

# hero hotkeys numbers
For my game they are off see screenshot. Nice would be that first hero is on one, second hero on two and so on.

# animation left overs
When a round is over there are some animation left overs, which are not finishing or cleanedup.

# navigation - leave skill screen
For more easier navigation it would be really nice if you can close the skill screen with the right mouse button. So far only escape is working. This change makes the game nicer to play only wih mouse.

# gamestats recap - game over screen
When game is los then some screen with recap screen is shown. This is really hard to read since it is sooo tiny.
