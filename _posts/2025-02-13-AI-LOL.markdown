# AI LOL
I am a software developer, I like developing, I like writing code. AI is all the buzz agents jr. software developers,
but it does not pass a day where I see a video debunking the performance of AI. This article will be updated from 
time to time collecting all posts, articles dunking / debunking AI. Have a laught with we as long they are bad maybe one day
they will do all the things they promise and more and I will be out of a job, until then "AI LOL".
