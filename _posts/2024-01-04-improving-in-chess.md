# improving in chess

I am a firm beliver of consisty is key to improve within any topic. In order to be most consistant on topic time is mostly the constraint therefor a routine which is not very time consuming is very much needed. 

# 30 minute chess workout
I stumbled across a 30 minute chess workout for everyday use and it goes like this:
1. solve puzzles for 10 minutes
2. play games for 10 minutes
3. analyze your games or studdy chess

Since this is probbly not the best approach in order to get better at classical chess (since you only play max 10 minutes) this is not really a concern for me since I don't play much classical and starting out. 

# chess plattforms
Two main contenders I consider is lichess.com and chess24.com. For this operation one key feature sets them both apart. On lichess.com you can solve as many puzzels as you want but on chess.com you are limited by puzzels you can solve in a day if you don't go premium. Therefor we have a winner lichess.com

## example step2 : playing
With a large playerbase and as of this moment 68000 active players not hard to find an opponant to dable with. 
## example step3 : studdy / analyzing games
Since my opening knowledge is very limited at the moment (know your weaknesses) apart from looking at my own games I want to also build opening knowledge.
